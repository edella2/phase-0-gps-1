### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I didn't have any specific struggles prior to the GPS session

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Paired programming, this was my first experience with it.  I really enjoyed it and it shows how great it is for helping write clear code and catch mistakes early.  It was really nice having someone to bounce thoughts around with.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Most importantly we asked each other how we were doing today.  I also had questions regarding what were good practices for commit messages.

### What still confuses you about git?

Fetching and merging and their differences from just doing `git pull origin`.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Great, Katy was a fantastic guide! Test for conflict merge
